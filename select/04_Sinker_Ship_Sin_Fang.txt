(Now that you've gone the doves in the air knock down)

You're the one why I'm vised into the sun
You're the only one
You're the one I'm a sinking ship coming down

Take the sun apart and put it back together
Down the mount so you can forget her

I'm coming down, I see eyes in the mirror
An old rhino sweeps in rolled up in flames

It's hard to sing when your pain bleeds
Nothing more will ever make me feel
Like a plastic bag full of sick again

An armed sissy, an otter with brains...
But without a heart

(Some one will carry on) (Now that we are appeased)

I need to forget some words I said yesterday
Change them away from memories
And just change them all again

Found you back here again
You say the same things
But we can't be friends
As long as you're unsung out of the blame
