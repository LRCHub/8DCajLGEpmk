The first thing she done when they set her free
From the women's correctional facility
Was to come here askin' me for a reconciliation
She said she'd changed her ways for good
And all she was, was misunderstood
So I did everything I could for her rehabilitation
Hook, line and sinker - I swallowed all of her lies
Hook, line and sinker - she took me for a ride
Just one look at that innocent face
I didn't think twice, I just snapped up the bait
Hook, line and sinker
I helped her get on her feet again
I get her a job out at the Dixie Inn
I had to swear up and down to them
That the girl could be trusted
Two nights later she cleaned them out
She took my old Firebird and headed south
And when the cops came to my house, buddy
Guess who got busted?
Hook, line and sinker - I swallowed all of her lies
Hook, line and sinker - she took me for a ride
Just one look at that innocent face
I didn't think twice, I just snapped up the bait
Hook, line and sinker
When she told me how lonely she had been
I should have seen she was only reelin' me in
Hook, line and sinker
Just one look at that innocent face
I didn't think twice, I just snapped up the bait
Hook, line and sinker
