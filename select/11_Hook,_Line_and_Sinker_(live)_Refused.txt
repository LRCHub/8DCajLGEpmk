The bait. The prey. The mice. Debate the method of demise.
Debate your high. I'll lie beside you, walk you down and lay the beat beneath
Your bed. Beneath the dead.Debate the method in your head.
The chemical misanthropy saving you from blame.
I'll stand below you, lift you up, increase the pain. I want to see you, hear your
Voice regret the choice. Rejoice in watching you collapse, destroy
The map and fall headlong into the gap.
Swallow poison, swallow the bait.
Swallow every word said to free you from blame.
I'll stand below you, lift you up, increase the pain.
The hunter dying in his trap. Swallow poison, swallow the
Bait. Hook, line and sinker.
